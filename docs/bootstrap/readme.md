# Bootstrap (et al.)

This profile comes with the combination of TailwindCSS plus UIkit, but you can also use any other CSS framework or none at all.

When using tailwind with another framework, one important part is to disable the preflight mode in the tailwind config file. Please see the docs about tailwind for details.
