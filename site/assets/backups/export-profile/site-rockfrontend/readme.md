# RockFrontend Site Profile - RockFrontend + UIkit + TailwindCSS üöÄüòç

The RockFrontend site profile for ProcessWire offers a unique combination of benefits by integrating UIKit and TailwindCSS, making it an appealing choice for developers looking for both robust UI components and extensive customization capabilities. Here are some key advantages:

### Rich UI Components from UIKit

UIKit is known for its comprehensive collection of high-quality, ready-to-use UI components. This integration in the RockFrontend site profile allows developers to quickly implement complex components like modals, accordions, and sliders that are visually appealing and functionally robust.

### Flexibility and Customization with TailwindCSS

TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides high granularity in styling elements. It allows developers to build custom designs without stepping out of the framework‚Äôs constraints. This can significantly speed up the development process, as it eliminates the need to write custom CSS from scratch.

## Setup

Setup is as simple as these 3 steps:

1. Download the profile
2. Install ProcessWire and choose this profile
3. Follow the instructions on the welcome screen:

## New to NPM?

Please invest 15 minutes in getting to know NPM: https://youtu.be/P3aKRdUyr0s

So if you type "npm install -D" that means that you will install the dependencies listed here: https://github.com/baumrock/site-rockfrontend/blob/main/install/assets/package.json

At the time of writing this we only load one dependency: "tailwindcss": "^3.4" - obviously we need tailwind for the tailwind profile üôÇ

The flag "-D" means that we only need the dependency on development, not on production. So when deploying your site to a remote server you don't need to install anything from NPM (in other words: You don't need the folder "node_modules" on your live server).

## Installed Modules

- **RockFrontend** (including the great LATTE template engine and LiveReload feature)
- **AdminStyleRock** (PW backend in the color of your client)
- **RockAdminTweaks** (successor of AdminOnSteroids AOS)
- **TracyDebugger** (for better and faster development)
