### Features:
- **Easy Customization**: Users can create their own tweaks by simply adding PHP, JS, or CSS files.
- **Modular Design**: Each tweak is self-contained, making it easy to manage and configure.
- **Dynamic Loading**: Tweaks are loaded dynamically based on the user's selections, ensuring that only the necessary resources are used.

RockAdminTweaks is the successor to the popular ProcessWire module "AdminOnSteroids". While AdminOnSteroids provided a range of enhancements and customizations for the ProcessWire admin panel, RockAdminTweaks builds upon and extends these features with a more modular and dynamic approach. Users familiar with AdminOnSteroids will find RockAdminTweaks to be a familiar experience.
