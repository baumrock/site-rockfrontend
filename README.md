# RockFrontend Site Profile DEVELOPMENT BRANCH

This branch is the internal project used to keep the RockFrontend site profile up to date. On every commit the RockFrontend site profile will be deployed to the main branch.

The development branch uses Git Submodules to make it easy for me to pull updates and push changes when I need to. The site profile does not use submodules so that everybody can use it without this advanced setup.
